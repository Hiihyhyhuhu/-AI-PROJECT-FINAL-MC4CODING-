**FOREWORDS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Greetings to viewers, we are a group of students that were and are studying in Le Hong Phong Highschool for the gifted, HCMC, Vietnam. But for the company of CoTAI, we would not have made it to introduce you all about our AI product. Well, let’s start with GET TO KNOW US.

**INTERFACE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

***GET TO KNOW US***

We are here, stepping out of the safe zone, to ease your sorrow over getting somebody lost. By applying and implementing Artificial Intelligence, we desire to be supportive assistants in an endeavor to find family members and friends back. We highly appreciate the experience of users and ever-increase our product quality. Should any questions arise, contribute them to CONTACT US.

***GET TO KNOW YOU***

To start finding, let’s register an account first in GET TO KNOW YOU. For network safety, it is compulsory to confirm your identification with some basic personal information for further use. Including birthday (the age will be calculated automatically), hometown, phone number and personal email. Ultimately, we would recommend you to set up an avatar by uploading an image of yourself. When completing it, the register warning will disappear, and you can see your avatar in the left corner of the sidebar.

***FINDING SOMEONE***

Now, you can look up information about your relatives in FIND SOMEONE. Let’s try this out. Before finding results, it is of necessity to provide us with some specific traits that you are looking for, such as gender, age (comparative), relation between you guys (optional) and especially, facial characteristics. This is the most deciding step. The more detailed you describe, the more precise the model is. Subsequently, click DRAW to sketch out your found member. We use an application called Stable Diffusion Model to generate from text to image. Until you get the most precise sketch, you can redraw it at any time. Finally, click on FIND NOW to receive finding results. This process will be as fast as lightning in less than a minute. Checking these in FIND OUT. All the images you can see are extracted from Database attached with a matching precision rate of Face Recognition based on what you have described. You can click on any pictures to gain more corresponding information. Since this is a simple emulator, the Database used in this video is already available. After checking answers, using the Q&A tool Generative AI may help you choose a wise course of action whether you have or not found your relative.

**DEVELOPMENT ORIENTATION --------------------------------------------------------------------**

Down the road, our project is laying a groundwork for its Database to enhance the efficiency of finding people. Moreover, we are on the verge of launching this model to lend police a hand in arresting criminals when witnesses can do nothing but describe.
